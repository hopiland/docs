## SmallWorld pushes ahead toward the Green life

Our SmallWorld headquarters is presently located in Phnom Penh city, but not many people know we have a much larger long-term vision for SmallWorld's future.

We're focused on breaking away from polluted cities and stressful urban life, with a return to a clean, natural and organic life out in the countryside.

From our travels around the world, and through our work with information technologies, we know that the world needs more rural, sustainable eco-friendly communities for visiting digital nomads.

So what exactly is a digital nomad, or what some call the Worldwide Digital Nomad Community?

Imagine a world where you can work and live anywhere in the world.

With the recent rise of the Internet and information technologies, work locations are becoming increasingly irrelevant.

Along with this trend, we see the rise of the so-called digital nomad or technomad, a group of location independent workers able to live and work wherever they please.

Today there are several million individuals globally who engage in remote work and travel, and this trend is expected to grow by record numbers in the future.

With regular, reliable transportation between Phnom Penh and our rural "eco-campus", we envision our SmallWorld of the future as a place where we offer dorms, private rooms, meals, and a co-working space like none other Cambodia has seen.

We understand that we must begin to prepare ourselves now for this new, cleaner, healthier lifestyle, while influencing everyone around us to do the same.

So while we're still in Phnom Penh, we're focused on creating at SmallWorld a clean and sustainable living environment right now, as best as we are able.

Those of us who live and work in Phnom Penh know that excess waste and pollution is among our most serious problems.

Plastic pollution, air quality, and noise are serious deterants for a healthy living and work environment.

We want not only to change our own behavior, but to influence the behavior of everyone around us.

So let's begin with a war on plastic.

According to some estimates, around 10 million plastic bags are used in Phnom Penh every day.

Another way to look at it, each Cambodian who doesn't live in the countryside uses more than 2,000 plastic bags each year.

At SmallWorld, we're determined to find solutions, even if it means putting up with a little inconvenience, or spending an extra few dollars each month.

For a front line of attack, we want to encourage our colleagues and everyone we know to always carry and use re-useable materials.

To be clear, get your hands on a nice re-useable shopping bag, water bottle, and eating utensils, and carry these items with you.

Whenever you go out to eat or shop, don't just accept whatever the food vendor gives you.

Explain that you have your own bag, your own bottle, or your own reuseable food container.

Use you imagination and creativity to find new and convenient ways to get away from accepting plastic and styrofoam from food vendors.

Do you have some of your own creative ideas you can share with us?

How can we reduce the amount of plastic and styrofoam we use each day?

We really want to hear from you!

Next time we're going to discuss air and noise pollution, but for now we feel it's best to attack one problem at a time.

Our goal is not only to create Asia's best eco-campus and co-working space for digital nomads, but we're also determined to change the mindset of our nation's young people.

We want to encourage children and youths especially to love our earth and environment, since it is through nature all good things come to us.

We have only one Earth, one nation, one homeland, so let's begin now to treat it with respect and pride.

If we don't begin thinking ecologically now, we'll never be able to set a good example for our children, and then they'll most likely not care either.

We don't want this to happen, so let's all get to work now!
